Anyone is allowed to use NumberFlow Free in non-commercial applications.

If youâ€™d like to use NumberFlow in commercial applications and get access to all source code, you can buy per-seat licenses on the Unity Asset Store via

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/12902

Buying licenses also helps me - the developer - pay the bills. I consider this a good thing.
